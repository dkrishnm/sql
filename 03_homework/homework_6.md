**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.



With my previous experience as a software engineer with mental wellness industry, data ethics has been crucial to protect users privacy and giving them control over their data. This has been extremely important in maintaining trust and create a safe space for their mental health needs.

Use of personal data : As a user interface designer, itâ€™s important to create web pages that collect minimal data while still delivering effective support. Also we should identify data points which could reveal sensitive information

User accessibility: Design more features which give users more control on their data. They should have access to easily view and edit their personal information which is being shared. This would enable them to make more informed decisions about their well being.  Also the system would be more transparent

User Recommendations: While building personalized recommendations it should reflect their needs and reflect their diversity and mitigate any bias. This could be tailored to consider factors like race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background

Language support: Its important to support the website with content in multiple languages ensuring access to a wider user base.

The above adjustments helped build a valuable tool that promotes mental wellness in an ethical and equitable manner.
